    <!-- The change in the state of an object is known as an Event. In html, there
    are various events which represents that some activity is performed by the
    user or by the browser. When javascript code is included in HTML, js react
    over these events and allow the execution. This process of reacting over the
    events is called Event Handling. Thus, js handles the HTML events via Event
    Handlers. 
    
    For example, when a user clicks over the browser, add js code,
    which will execute the task to be performed on the event.

    events and their event handlers are:

    mouseup | onmouseup When the mouse button is released over the element 
    mousemove | onmousemove When the mouse movement takes place.
